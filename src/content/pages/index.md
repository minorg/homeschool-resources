People come to homeschooling for many different reasons and from many different backgrounds. When we started homeschooling our kids in 2022 we quickly realized that we were also relatively unique in our own ways. We are both recovering academics, with PhDs in history and computer science, respectively. We live in a suburban area of upstate New York where there are few homeschoolers and even fewer secular ones. We are avid readers who are passionate about sharing our love of learning – and our burgeoning home library – with our family and friends.

We’ve been fortunate to have great mentors in homeschooling since we started, and we’ve tried to help other people in turn. This website is part of that – a way to share what we’ve learned with folks who are just getting started as well as current homeschoolers who are looking for new ideas. While there are plenty of homeschooling resources on the web and social media, very few of them seem to speak to people like us. After a few years teaching at home ourselves we felt it was time to rectify that, and connect with people whose stories are similar to our own.
